									<h2><a href="#">Snake Game Project</a></h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" /></a>
								<p>I created the classic old snake game as my first project in the Programming Fundamental Class. I use the basic and simple concpet of loops, nested loops, function, variable etc to built this game. It is a simple game like the old classic if the snake head eat it tails get bigger and if the head and the tail meet then the snake will die and its game over. I develop this game on the console without a GUI with my programming knowledge.</p>

If a new book is added to the library, the administrator can insert it, or delete it if it is no longer available. The user can ask the admin to issue them a book, check if the book has been issued to them, and return the book they have received from the admin. Each user will be assigned a unique user ID.</p>
